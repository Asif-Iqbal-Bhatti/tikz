# Random TikZ Collection

Gallery site of `standalone` TikZ images, source code included. Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev).

## Running this site locally

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/janosh/tikz
   cd tikz/site
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the dev server:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a development server with this site running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it and the page will hot-reload to display your changes.
